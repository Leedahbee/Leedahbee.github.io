### About Me
I am an Undergraduate Biology Student at SNHU with prior coursework at Nova Southeastern University. I am a full time student focusing on a pre-medical school concentration while also maintaining two jobs. I work part time at Roy's Auto Sales & Service as the Marketing and Sales Manager where I manage marketing, advertizing, social media prescence, and sales as well as doing some service writing. I also work Per-deim as a Mobility Technician at Elliot Hospital. My duties at Elliot hospital include assisting and motivating patients to mobilize during their inpatient hospital stay, assiting with patient transfers and assisting with physical therapy activity orders. In my free time I enjoy painting, playing the baritone saxophone for the SNHU Wind Symphony, and spending time with my dog and family.
