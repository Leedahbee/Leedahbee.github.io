### About Me
I am an Undergraduate Biology Student at SNHU with prior coursework at Nova Southeastern University. I am a full time student focusing on a pre-medical school concentration while also maintaining two jobs. I work part time at Roy's Auto Sales & Service as the Marketing and Sales Manager where I manage marketing, advertizing, social media prescence, and sales as well as doing some service writing. I also work Per-deim as a Mobility Technician at Elliot Hospital. My duties at Elliot hospital include assisting and motivating patients to mobilize during their inpatient hospital stay, assiting with patient transfers and assisting with physical therapy activity orders. In my free time I enjoy painting, playing the baritone saxophone for the SNHU Wind Symphony, and spending time with my dog and family.

### Past Projects
#### [Palmer Penguins Data Analysis](https://github.com/Leedahbee/BioStatisticsAnalysis/blob/main/Palmer%20Penguins%20v2.html.md) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My first foray into coding and BioStatistcs. Using the palmer penguins data set to understand how to code using R to make data tables, charts, and graphs. The Palmer Penguins Data set includes penguin population data from three islands and includes data on several factors such as species, sex, bill lengths and depths, flipper length. Other than learning more about how to use r as a coding language I also was curious whether the data set included any significant outliers, and addressed this question using the knowlege learned from the data analysis in the earlier part of the project.

#### [Dog Breeds Biostatistical Analysis](https://github.com/Leedahbee/BioStatisticsAnalysis/blob/main/Dog%20Breeds%20Biostats.qmd) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Little Dog Syndrome and Large Dogs as Gentle Giants? This Analysis seeks to find out if there is any eviednce in the data set that the trait scores of large and small breeds fit the sterotypes. Using charts and tables to support conclusions an in depth analysis of hundreds of dog breeds on traits such as how good they are with children and other dogs, their barking level, and their trainability. Also includes an added analysis about the possible bias of the data set due to troubling trends found during the main analysis.

#### [RNA-seq Part 1](https://github.com/Leedahbee/BioInformatics-/blob/main/RNA%20Seq%20FINAL.qmd) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RNA-seq is a burgeoning new genetic technique used to better understand organisms by way of RNA quantification. Using high throughput seqeuncing methods RNA of a whole species or specific genes there of can be quantified by their expression. This particular analysis looks at the expression of 15,000 genes of the organism _Drosophila melanogaster_. In particular, looking at the difference in gene expression during the first versus second instar. It was determined that there were several genes related to the epidermis on various areas of the organism that are expressed differently between different stages of embryonic development.
<br/>

#### [RNA-seq Part 2](https://github.com/Leedahbee/BioInformatics-/blob/main/RNA%20Seq%20dos.qmd) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Building on the ideas and techniques learned in Part 1 of the RNA-seq project, the model plant _Arabidopsis_ was used to create a heatmap. The resulting heatmap was used to better visualize the different gene expression patterns in the plant RNA. It was noted that there may be inverse relationship between genes 2 and 3 in particualar in the plant root due to the difference in log(TPM) values between the two genes.
